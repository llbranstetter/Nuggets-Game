# CS50 Nuggets
## Implementation Spec
##### Team Big D Nuggies, Fall 2024

According to the [Requirements Spec](REQUIREMENTS.md), the Nuggets game requires two standalone programs: a client and a server.
Our design also includes x, y, z modules.
We describe each program and module separately.
We do not describe the `support` library nor the modules that enable features that go beyond the spec.
We avoid repeating information that is provided in the requirements spec.

#### Plan for division of labor

*Leah*: Client module, Player module (do this first, so that we can work on gamestatus), spectator module (this can happen last)

*Jake*: Grid module (visibility), then help with server

*Kellen*: Gold module first, then Gamestatus module, and help Rana with server

*Rana*: Server module, ended up rewriting gamestatus and gold modules

Unit testing is being done by Jake, Kellen, and Leah for their respecitive modules, and system/integration testing will be done all together

### Client

#### Data structures

This module will use the data structures `player_t` and `spectator_t` as written in the player and spectator modules. 
`ncurses.h` - library that provides data structures for initializing the screen and printing out the grid. This also handles resizing (for resizing the screen)

#### Definition of function prototypes

The functions defined in `miniclient.c` provide the main structure for the setup and interaction between the server and client. They allow the client to handle messages from the server and send input to the server. As such, the main functions in `client.c` will be very similar or the same as the functions in `miniclinent.c`, but we will implement helper functions to better specify the client functions for the purposes of the game and to handle the specific messages that we will be receiving from the server.

A function to parse the command-line arguments, initialize the game struct, initialize the message module, and (BEYOND SPEC) initialize analytics module. 
A function to handle messages by calling helper functions depending on which type of message it receives from the server. For example if it receives a GOLD message, it will call the `handleGold` function. It uses strcmp to identify which message it will call.
A function to handle input from the client and send it to the server. It will send the server 3 message types: PLAY, SPECTATE, and KEY.
A main function that runs parseArgs and initializes other functions to construct a working client that connects and interacts with the server.

Helper functions (called by handleMessage) to handle each type of message that you can receive from the server (these will each have print functions that print out the data sent by the server): OK, GRID, GOLD, DISPLAY, QUIT, and ERROR.

```c
static int parseArgs(const int argc, char* argv[]);
static bool handleMessages(void* arg, const addr_t from, const char* message);
static bool handleOK(const char* message);
static bool handleGrid(const char* message);
static bool handleGold(const char* message);
static bool handleDisplay(const char* message);
static bool handleQuit(const char* message);
static bool handleError(const char* message);
static bool handleDisplay(const char* message);
static bool handleInput(void* arg);
int main(const int argc, char* argv[]);
```

#### Detailed pseudo code

> For each function write pseudocode indented by a tab, which in Markdown will cause it to be rendered in literal form (like a code block).
> Much easier than writing as a bulleted list!
> For example:

##### `parseArgs`: (this follows the code in `miniclient.c`)

	validate commandline
	initialize message module
	print assigned port number
	decide whether spectator or player

##### `handleMessages`

	validate commandline
	If Gold
		handleGold
	If OK
		handleOK
	If Grid
		handleGrid
	If Display
		handleDisplay
	If Quit
		handleQuit
	If Error
		handleError

	Return false

##### `handleInput`  (this follows the code in `miniclient.c`)
	Arg = addr_t
	Validate commandline
	Allocate buffer to read input
	Read input from stdin
	Check strcmp to decide which type of input it is
	Create a message and send it to the server
	(it is the serverâ€™s job to check the message type and validate the message)

---

### Server

#### Data structures

The server will only be maintaining to references to the data structures that we build up in the other modules, namely gameStatus_t (which in turn will likely use player_t, spectator_t, gold_t, grid_t)

#### Definition of function prototypes
The implementation went through several iterations and this is what we decided on for the server.

#### Data structures

One structure to store all player specific information and being able to retrieve it. **player_t** 
Stores player-specific information, including: 
```c
typedef struct player {
char* name;
int ID; // unique ID used to identify a player
int position;  // player position
int score; // Amount of gold collected by the player
addr_t IPaddress;
}
```

#### Definition of function prototypes

```c
player_t* player_new(const addr_t address, char* name, int ID, grid_t* grid);
void player_setLocation(player_t* player, int position);
int player_getLocation(player_t* player);
void player_addGold(player_t* player, int value);

### Testing plan

#### Unit testing

#### Player and Spectator
These will mainly be tested as part of our testing of the server and client modules. The basic functions will be tested in a simple main function in each file that creates a spectator and player struct and then calls the functions on each struct and prints their output. 

#### Grid
This will be tested in a main function in the typedef file that creates a grid and uses the functions on the grid to ensure they are giving the correct output. Further testing will occur during the integration and system testing.

#### Gold
This will be tested in the same manner as grid, using a main function within the typedef file. Further testing will occur during the integration and system testing.


#### Integration testing
We will add the basic server functionality and test it by checking if the server starts successfully and accepts connections.
Confirm that the server can add players and spectators correctly. Check that counts of active players and spectators are accurate.
Validate that the server can receive and process messages from players. Ensure that game status is updated appropriately based on these messages.
Finally, do a full simulation of a full game scenario where players join, send messages, and the game state evolves. Verify that players see the correct environment, and interactions (like movement and actions) update the game state correctly.

We will test client by running tests to ensure that the client can connect to various server ports using the provided server in the shared directory and the miniclient. We will also test the player and spectator classes within the client module as they will be initiated and used there. Most of the testing will occur in the integration testing and system testing.

#### System testing

We will first test the client and server separately to ensure that they are working on their own. Then we will do our final tests on the serverâ€™s ability to properly connect to the client and print out messages to each other. We will begin testing with simple cases of printing messages between the client and server (likely with the client acting as a spectator), and we will gradually upgrade the difficulty of test cases to make sure that multiple clients can connect to a server simultaneously with both a spectator and a player role.

##### Testing Results
After a lot of debugging by connecting server to shared directory client and our client to shared directory server, we were able to run multiple runs of the test. The most useful feature of these test runs was the logging module that we used. In the client folder, you shall find testrunP1, testrunP2, & testrunS. In the server folder, you shall find testrun. All of these log files correspond to a big system test we performed which involved 2 players and a spectator coming in and getting kicked out by another during the match. We then checked for valrind errors in server which was completely free of memory errors and memory leaks. The client did have memory leaks but these were all regarding the ncurses library which we were told to ignore. Obviously, we conducted a lot more testing but for the sake of not taking up too much space, we chose to commit only these log files.

### Our Map
Our map can be found in the maps directory called "bigDMap.txt". 

#### Limitations
Our assumptions are listed in the README.
- Server can only handle up to 26 clients 
- We will assume that the map file is a valid map
- Only one client can join as a spectator
